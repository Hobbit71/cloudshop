CloudShop
=========

CloudShop is a cloud-native e-commerce platform designed as a polyglot, microservices-oriented monorepo. It provides a modern foundation for building scalable online stores with best practices for local development, CI/CD, observability, and production readiness.

Key characteristics:
- Polyglot services (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- Microservice-first, API-driven architecture
- PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching/queues, Elasticsearch for search
- Modular service onboarding with consistent tooling and environments

Status: This repository contains the core developer experience, infra for local dev, and contribution scaffolding. Individual microservices are added separately.

Quick start
-----------

Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop 4.x+
- Make (GNU make)
- Optional: VS Code with Dev Containers extension

Steps:
1. Copy the example environment file and adjust as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Start local infrastructure (databases, cache, search, mock gateway):
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
3. Verify services are healthy:
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
   - Redis: localhost:6379
   - Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200
   - Mock payment gateway (WireMock): http://localhost:8080/__admin

Common commands
---------------

```bash
# One-time setup helpers
make setup

# Start/stop local infra
make dev       # up -d
make clean     # down -v

# Build and test (monorepo-wide placeholders, customize per service)
make build
make test

# Deploy locally (alias of dev; customize for k8s or kind/minikube later)
make deploy-local
```

Repository layout (planned)
---------------------------

```
/services
  /gateway              # API gateway / BFF
  /auth                 # Authentication & sessions
  /catalog              # Products, categories, attributes
  /cart                 # Cart operations
  /order                # Orders & checkout
  /inventory            # Stock, reservations
  /payment              # Payment integration (mocks locally)
  /notification         # Email/SMS/webhook
/libs                   # Shared libraries, contracts, SDKs
/infra                  # Local infra helpers (mappings, scripts)
```

Development environment
-----------------------

- Dev Container: See `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for a polyglot toolchain.
- Local infra: `docker-compose.yml` provisions PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and a mock payment gateway (WireMock).
- Environments: Use `.env` at repo root for shared defaults; services may also have their own env files.

Security and secrets
--------------------

- Do not commit secrets. Use `.env` locally and secret managers in higher environments.
- Rotate secrets regularly; prefer short TTLs for tokens.
- Ensure JWT signing keys and database credentials are unique per environment.

Contributing and governance
---------------------------

- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the workflow, commit conventions, and code review expectations.
- See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community standards.
- Changes should be recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` per Keep a Changelog.
